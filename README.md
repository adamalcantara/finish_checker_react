  ## Deployed Project
  [Finish Checker](https://finishchecker.com/)

  ## Description 
My favorite hobby is building guitars. Like many other hobbyists, I lack constant access to a temperature controlled spray area. I wanted to create an application for myself and others that would indicate whether or not weather conditions are correct for spraying the nitrocellulose finish commonly found on guitars.

This application is built in React, with the Weather API from OpenWeather providing the up-to-date information. Finish Checker uses Geolocation to get the weather of the user's current location. If users choose to opt out of Geolocation, they may also search for their zip code.
